It is a company who don‚Äôt value the customer.I purchased my HP laptop from Amazon in May \'22 and since Aug \'22 (in less than 3 months of purchase) I am facing the issue of ""Battery Calibration Error"". Initially I thought there might be small issue and will be resolved with consultation with an engineer but it was not so. This issue was repetitive and after so many communications through virtual, telephonic as well as email with HP the battery of laptop got replaced in Nov \'22.Again, from Dec \'22 (within 25 days of battery replacement) the problem started. This time when I called HP, a customer relationship manager asked me that "" mam if the unit is functioning well then why do not you ignore this error"".I got shocked with such reply, who can accept a new laptop with such a big error?Is this a way to satisfy a customer or strategy of HP for convincing a customer.I asked him that what will happen if this issue repeat after a warranty period; again, a shocking reply from customer relationship manager of HP"" Mam you may handle by availing a paid service extension scheme"".Anyways after so many conversations a HP technical team came and collect few more data from my laptop and concluded that now this laptop needs ""replacement of a Motherboard"".The history card is so long that it shows how problematic the piece HP have delivered to me is!!!!On top of the long-running R&D by HP on this defective supplied unit, a customer relationship manager giving me the timeline for closing the case in a day if I fail to give my decision for replacement of a motherboard.Read more', 'Excellent laptop to sum up.1) very light weight.2) boots super fast in 5-7 seconds.3) good battery.4) comes with win 11 so latest and updated.5) very competitive in terms of price.6) handy due to 14‚Äù screen. All others are 15.6‚Äù which is bulky, and too large to handle.7) hdd is 256GB SSD but if u add a 1 Tb external disk then also price turns to be better than Lenovo and Dell.8) buyback I got for a 7 yr old laptop is 9500/-. That was awesome. The laptop was in perfect condition. But slow. Still 9500/- is an excellent buyback value.9) no bag comes with this. So plan a slide in bag (available at less than 1000/- on Amazon) or a bigger one as per ur choice.Overall this is an excellent deal.Read more']"
