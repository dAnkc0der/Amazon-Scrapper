# Amazon-Scrapper
# Steps
1). Clone the repository on your desktop [git clone "file link"]. Open the folder containing files in any IDE of choice. Change the path to that file

2). Need to install 3 libraries which are requests [pip install python-csv], csv [pip install python-csv], and beautiful-soup [pip install beautifulsoup4].


3). Run the python script using "python submit.py"  


Note -:                                                                                                                                     

- Make sure to add User-agent in the program. This can be found by going to site [whatismybrowser.com -> detect-settings -> user-agent]. Copy the user-agent and paste at the blank user-agent space. [User-Agent has been removed for security reasons].                                                       
- Also include the number of product_item that you wish to see in the csv file. Default is set at 50.[search for num_products. located at the end of the script]. Higher the number more will be the time to fetch the data from the amazon server.
